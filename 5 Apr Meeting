- ash vs population (more nutrients?) [mf]
- merging volc types [caleb & rena (done)]
- merging event types [caleb]
- count vs proportion of event types for each type of volc [calebs part]
- flip axis of volc type & events [caleb]
- population vs no. eruption scatterplot [rena] - frequency issues cause of diff formation time 
- population vs vei (can change colour according to volc type) scatterplot [rena]
- label no. eruptions [yian]
- geo plot size = population for each volc [mf]
- no. eruption vs tectonic plate need to do according to proportion [yian]  - frequency issues cause of diff formation time 
- medium intensity have higher duration [yian found]
- temp & sulfur no correlation [reb found]

- 3 simple ones on population agaisnt volc type (just to see) [Reb -> forgot to do the prev time] size on map??
population (5km) agaisnt volc type
population (10km) agaisnt volc type
population (30km) agaisnt volc type
- population vs duration since last eruption


Q1: population (inc stages, then how ash affect pop, then vei and pop)
Q2: what affects freq of eruption (inc. sulfur, ...)



caleb:
swap axes, merge primary volcano type, cut down on certain stages (merge event type)

yian:
label number of eruptions, add the 2 locations?

ming feng:
initial map (keep)
relationship of stages and population 

rena:
change to primary volcano type & their vei spread (keep)

rebecca:

Q1) factors affexting population
- stages and its priamry volcano types
- vei and population
- vei and primary volcano types

Q2) eruptions (description)
- global map: vei and tectonic plate for each volcano on the world map (against time?) 
- sulfur and eruption
- tectonics
