To Do:
- check what eruption_category affects (whether to remove uncertain eruption) [explain our decision]
- bottom 500 volcs 
    -- top 100, bottom 100 
    -- volc in ocean -> remove those w no pop at all zero [Q2(b) MF]
- plot volcano colours on map by zones, not by crust type [Q? DONE by MF]
- how frequent do volcs erupt (sort by types) [Q1(a) Yian]
- General stages of eruptions/activity according to event type [Q1(b) Caleb]
- effects of eruption (sulfur) - could be affected by no. eruptions/ type of volcanoes that erupted [Q1(c) Reb,Yian]
- ave vei, group by volc, to check if vei is affected by major rocks in general [Q2(a) Rena]
- 3 simple ones on population agaisnt volc type (just to see) [Reb]
    --  population (5km) agaisnt volc type
    --  population (10km) agaisnt volc type
    --  population (30km) agaisnt volc type


1. frequency of volcano eruptions and its different stages affect the sulfur level in air

a) group by volcano type and check the frequnecy of eruptions to see which volcano type is more prone to erupt [Yian]

b) common stages across volcanic eruptions by eruption number [Caleb]

c) effects of sulfur and volcano eruption activity [Reb, Yian]

2. average vei of different volcanoes determines the major rock type and how they are seen across the various distances from volcanoes

a) average vei of different volcanoes determines the major rock type {ack) [Rena]

b) major rocks types of top 500 volcanoes at 5km (check other radius) [MF]
